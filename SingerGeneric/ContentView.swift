 For more flexibility ,
 we could improve our `FilteredLisView`
 so that it works with any kind of entity ,
 and can filter on any field .
 To make this work properly ,
 we need to make a few changes :
 `1.`Rather than specifically referencing the `Singer` class ,
 we are going to use generics with a constraint
 that whatever is passed in
 must be an `NSManagedObject` .
 `2.`We need to accept a second parameter
 to decide which key name we want to filter on ,
 because we might be using an entity that doesn’t have a `lastName` attribute .
 `3.`Because we don’t know ahead of time what each entity will contain ,
 we are going to let our containing view decide .
 So , rather than just using a text view of a singer’s name ,
 we are instead going to ask for a closure
 that can be run to configure the view however they want .
